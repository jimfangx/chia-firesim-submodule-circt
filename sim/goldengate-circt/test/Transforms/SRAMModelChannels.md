# Optional SRAM channel preparation

`--analyze-sram-channels` executes native FIRRTL/MLIR transformations through
`InferModelPorts`: SRAM wrapping, transitive model promotion, aggregate lowering,
passthrough promotion, default channels, clock inference, channel excision, and
module-local port grouping. This follows `MidasTransforms.scala`'s ordering and
stops at the graph consumed by `FAMETransform.scala`. The input must already have
a wrapped top, a target-clock channel, and resolved last-connect semantics.

The boundary emits `post-sram-channels.fir`,
`post-sram-channels-all.json`, and `post-sram-channel-dependencies.json`.
It binds global channels back to inferred local groups and runs the native
combinational analysis used by FAME output-valid generation. Unsupported paths
fail the boundary instead of producing an apparently independent output.
FIRRTL 1.2 statements and a large line margin let
the pinned Scala parser inspect the candidate directly. The comparator ignores
CIRCT's `public` module keyword, which the old parser does not understand.

## Oracle and comparison

The immutable compiler input used in iteration 45 is:

```
/scratch/jfx/fsim-circt/sims/firesim-staging/generated-src/firechip.chip.FireSim.FireSimRocketConfig.sfc-golden-2026-10-01/firechip.chip.FireSim.FireSimRocketConfig.sfc.fir
```

`SRAMModelChannelsOracle.scala` uses unchanged Scala passes to prepare that
input in LowForm, select its real `Rocket` hierarchy and `rf` memory, add a
minimal 1:1 target-clock channel, and wrap the top. Both compilers consume the
same emitted `golden-rocket.channels-input.fir/json`. This isolates optional
SRAM behavior; the recorded configuration does not select SRAM models by
default. The script also prepares a multiport memory with four instances across
two hierarchy levels (`fanout.channels-input.fir/json`). Its wrapped input is
checked in as `SRAMModelChannels.fir/json` for CTest.

The comparator checks annotation multisets, top-port direction/type and actual
instance-port bindings, promoted model identities, and SRAM port widths,
memory depth, latency, reader/writer/readwriter names, and read-under-write
behavior. It maps legal hub instance-name differences using actual FIRRTL
connections. It compares both-ended pipe channels by endpoint identity rather
than their generated global name, preserving clocks, payload order and
multiplicity. Original top-level I/O names remain part of the ABI comparison.
The comparator follows direct, type-matched hub output aliases: SFC binds eight
Rocket top outputs to equivalent hub outputs instead of their explicitly
assigned aliases. Both artifacts contain those assignments. Only SFC's
compiler-history `DedupedResult` records are excluded.
No Scala hardware transformation runs on the native candidate.

The comparison exposed extra native annotations. `FAMEDefaults` now emits one
module label for repeated instances of that module, and `InferModelPorts`
protects a shared clock/port once. Existing labels/protection seed those sets.
These changes match SFC `runTransform`'s annotation uniqueness without removing
unrelated annotations. The fanout mismatch was three duplicate module labels
and 48 duplicate protection records; the Rocket mismatch was nine duplicate
protection records.

After the fixes, both comparisons pass:

| Input | Top models (including hub) | Top ports | Channels | Local groups | Annotation records |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Four-instance fanout | 5 | 115 | 53 | 66 | 197 |
| Golden Rocket register file | 2 | 537 | 11 | 21 | 100 |

The fanout also retains four distinct channel clock-source targets and 70
unique port-protection records. CTest checks the graph and pre-existing
annotation cases, plus valid emitted statement newlines. The four focused
tests pass; the Scala comparisons additionally check SRAM memory semantics.

## Reproduction

Source `sourceme-manager.sh --skip-ssh-setup` from `sims/firesim` first.
Compile both `ExtractSRAMModelsOracle.scala` and
`SRAMModelChannelsOracle.scala` with the pinned Scala 2.13 compiler and Midas
dependency classpath. Then, with `evidence` pointing to a mutable output
directory inside the repository:

```sh
java -Xmx12G -cp "$oracle_classes:$midas_classpath" SRAMModelChannelsOracle \
  "$evidence/oracle" "$immutable_sfc_fir"
for name in fanout golden-rocket; do
  "$native_compiler" "$evidence/oracle/$name.channels-input.fir" \
    --annotation-file "$evidence/oracle/$name.channels-input.json" \
    --output-dir "$evidence/$name-candidate" --analyze-sram-channels
done
java -Xmx4G -cp "$oracle_classes:$midas_classpath" SRAMModelChannelsCompare "$evidence"
ctest --test-dir "$native_build" --output-on-failure \
  -R 'goldengate-(sram-model-channels|extract-model|label-sram-models|fame-output-selection)$'
```

Iteration 45 artifacts are under the mutable U250 generated directory's
`iteration45-sram-channels/`: oracle inputs/results, native candidates,
`comparison.log`, `ctest.log`, and `baseline.stdout/stderr`. The fresh native
baseline also passed through all FAME channel/control rewrites and PrintBridge
host binding with empty stderr. Manager verification remains harness-owned.

## Dependency boundary (iteration 46)

The new analysis exposed a clock-binding mismatch. SFC projects a global
channel clock into `clockPort` only for the module exporting that clock.
The SRAM on the other end has no local `clockPort` and uses FAME's virtual
clock channel. Native binding now accepts that remote clock while continuing
to require exact port/instance identity on the owner. Unit tests reject a
missing owner clock, a falsely RAM-local clock, and a clock from the wrong side
without changing IR.

Native combinational analysis now emits one result per module-local output
group, including when four SRAM instances or multiple transport branches
bind the same group. Every global channel and binding remains present.
`test/Analysis/SRAMChannelDependenciesOracle.scala` compares these results
with the unchanged `FAMEChannelAnalysis`/`CheckCombLoops` graph using
`FAMETransform`'s LI-BDN step 2. It compares input-channel sets because AND
dependency order does not affect output validity, and rejects duplicate
native output identities. It also writes the SFC dependency artifacts.

Fresh preparation from the immutable `.sfc.fir` above produces:

| Input | Model definitions | Local outputs | Dependency edges |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Four-instance fanout | 2 | 46 | 0 |
| Golden Rocket register file | 2 | 10 | 4 |

Both graphs match SFC. The synchronous reader/readwriter outputs have no
combinational input dependencies. Each of Rocket's two asynchronous register
file reads depends on its own address and enable channels; write inputs do
not enter those output-valid conditions. The structure/annotation comparison
still passes with the counts above. All six focused tests pass, including
combinational dependency and channel-clock-domain regressions. A fresh native
baseline through PrintBridge host binding passes with empty stderr.

Artifacts are under `iteration46-sram-dependencies/` in the same mutable
U250 generated directory: `oracle/golden-rocket.channels.sfc.fir/json`,
`oracle/golden-rocket.dependencies.sfc.json`, the corresponding native
`golden-rocket-candidate/` outputs, fanout artifacts, build and comparison
logs, `ctest.log`, and `baseline.stdout/stderr`. Compile the additional
`test/Analysis/SRAMChannelDependenciesOracle.scala` alongside the two oracle
files above, then run:

```sh
java -Xmx4G -cp "$oracle_classes:$midas_classpath" \
  midas.passes.fame.SRAMChannelDependenciesOracle "$evidence"
ctest --test-dir "$native_build" --output-on-failure \
  -R 'goldengate-(sram-model-channels|comb-dependency|fame-output-selection|fame-channel-clock-domains|extract-model|label-sram-models)$'
```

## Virtual-clock hardware boundary (iteration 47)

`--rewrite-sram-clocks` runs the native preparation/dependency boundary above,
then constructs virtual-clock hardware on the SRAM definitions selected by
their typed read/write/readwriter annotations. It adds host clock/reset to
each definition and every promoted instance, creates a reset-zero enable
register with `next = finishing ? 1 : enabled`, and connects the shared
`AbstractClockGate` with `CE = enabled & finishing & ~hostReset`. Memory clocks
use that gate's output. The original target-clock input and ancillary instance
clock writes are removed. Scalar data ports and retained annotations stay
unchanged. Models with explicit local clock channels/associations are rejected;
retained annotations targeting the removed clock are also rejected.

This is a partial FAME boundary: `targetCycleFinishing` is reserved for the
subsequent data-channel/FSM rewrite and remains undriven here. This artifact
is not a complete executable FAME model or a default-build SRAM implementation.

`SRAMVirtualClocksOracle.scala` runs the unchanged `FAMEModuleTransformer` on
the independent SFC-prepared models. It resolves reference types/kinds in the
oracle first, as Midas does before clock substitution. The native candidate
is only parsed. The comparison checks all eight enable/finishing/reset input
combinations, register clock/reset/init, gate input, every reader/writer/
readwriter clock, memory specification, scalar data ABI, and host clock/reset
wiring on every promoted instance. Both the four-instance fanout model and
the real Rocket `rf` model derived freshly from the immutable `.sfc.fir` above
match. SFC emits no non-hub generated-clock XDC annotations. The native
annotation output exactly matches its pre-clock preparation output.

CTest additionally checks four host interfaces, removal of all ancillary
SRAM instance clock writes, all three memory port clocks, constant-one
virtual enable, unchanged annotations, and rejection of a protected clock.
Seven focused tests pass. A direct native baseline through PrintBridge host
binding passes; manager validation remains harness-owned.

Artifacts are in the mutable U250 generated directory's
`iteration47-sram-clocks/`: `oracle/golden-rocket.virtual-clock.sfc.fir/json`,
`golden-rocket-clocks/post-sram-clocks.fir` and its annotation sidecar, fanout
equivalents, `clock-comparison.log`, `ctest.log`, and baseline stdout/stderr.
Compile `SRAMVirtualClocksOracle.scala` alongside the preparation oracle files
above, then run:

```sh
for name in fanout golden-rocket; do
  "$native_compiler" "$evidence/oracle/$name.channels-input.fir" \
    --annotation-file "$evidence/oracle/$name.channels-input.json" \
    --output-dir "$evidence/$name-clocks" --rewrite-sram-clocks
done
java -Xmx4G -cp "$oracle_classes:$midas_classpath" \
  midas.passes.fame.SRAMVirtualClocksOracle "$evidence"
ctest --test-dir "$native_build" --output-on-failure \
  -R 'goldengate-(sram-model-channels|fame-virtual-clock-port|fame-clock-gate|fame-clock-gate-identity|fame-output-selection|comb-dependency|fame-channel-clock-domains)$'
```

## Remaining scope

This establishes the optional SRAM channel graph. It does not yet connect
optional memory selection to the default FireSim build, finish FAME data-channel
hardware rewriting on these promoted models, or emit abstract RAM timing models.
The next step is to channelize the single Rocket SRAM model's data ports and
construct its fired/ready/valid/finishing rules from the verified dependency
graph. Repeated model instances still need instance-aware data-port rewriting.
