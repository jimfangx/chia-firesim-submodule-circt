# Archived U250 compiler replay, iteration 167

The native FAME input normalization now runs CIRCT DropConst after ground
type lowering and before ExpandWhens. SFC's LowForm input to FAME has no
constant type qualifier. CIRCT's imported constant predicates caused
ExpandWhens to construct an ordinary UInt conjunction with a const UInt
result in BOOM, Gemmini and Shuttle. The verifier rejected those operations.
Dropping the qualifier preserves the literal values and retained targets.

The regression in `Analysis/CombDependencyAnalysisTest.cpp` reproduces that
failure with a constant inner predicate under a dynamic outer `when`. It
checks verified normalized IR, retained output identity, dependencies and
the output selection for 32 input combinations. Both `goldengate-comb-dependency`
and `goldengate-lower-types-targets` CTests passed. The fixture failed with
the same const/UInt verifier diagnostic before adding DropConst.

`sim/make/goldengate.mk` now passes the actual `PLATFORM_CONFIG` to the native
compiler. Base U250 and the existing AutoILA fragments are supported;
unported partition/QSFP profiles fail before output creation. This exposes
an implementation gap instead of applying base U250 semantics to a partition.
All thirteen recipe profiles were checked through Make dry runs. Six invalid
CLI cases checked missing/empty/duplicate configurations and invalid ILA depth.

## Replay and comparison

The immutable matrix manifest is:

```
/scratch/jfx/fsim-circt/automation/chia_firesim_circt/golden/u250-sfc-20261013/manifest.json
```

`U250TargetMatrix.py` invokes the actual native compiler using each recipe's
archived `.sfc.fir`, `.anno.json` and effective platform configuration, with
separate candidate directories. It compares full annotation record multisets,
including constructors, targets, ordered endpoints and clocks. A failed,
unsupported or mismatched row makes the matrix return nonzero.

Source `sourceme-manager.sh --skip-ssh-setup` before running the standalone test:

```bash
python3 sim/goldengate-circt/test/U250TargetMatrix.py \
  --manifest /scratch/jfx/fsim-circt/automation/chia_firesim_circt/golden/u250-sfc-20261013/manifest.json \
  --compiler <native-build>/goldengate-circt --output-dir <fresh-output> --jobs 2
```

This run's artifacts are under:

```
/scratch/jfx/fsim-circt/sims/firesim/sim/generated-src/xilinx_alveo_u250/xilinx_alveo_u250-firesim-FireSim-FireSimRocketConfig-BaseXilinxAlveoU250Config/iteration167-u250-target-matrix/
```

`replay/matrix.json` and `replay/matrix.md` retain all thirteen rows and exact
commands, hashes, logs, candidates and comparison paths. Native compiler SHA256:
`67e051326d16d3475dbb667180b1e66e41618b6e54070094567e830d2a5eab80`.
`initial-inventory.json` records the pre-fix base-target failures. Comparisons
were extended to model-port annotations after replay, without recompiling.

| Target | Native result after normalization fix | Bridge/channel records |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rocket single | Compiled | 8 / 43 matched |
| Rocket quad | Multiple TracerV constructors unsupported | 11 / 79 matched |
| BOOM | Wider TracerV constructor unsupported | 8 / 62 matched |
| Rocket with NIC | Optional widget constructor key rejected | Not reached |
| Gemmini Rocket | FASED maxFlight=20 unsupported | 8 / 43 matched |
| Saturn Rocket | FASED maxFlight=20 unsupported | 8 / 43 matched |
| Saturn Shuttle | Wider TracerV constructor unsupported | 8 / 51 matched |
| Dual Rocket split base, 0, 1 | Three distinct partition/QSFP rejections | Not reached |
| Quad Rocket ring base, 0, 1 | Three distinct partition/QSFP rejections | Not reached |

For each reached bridge boundary, the exact SFC artifact is
`<manifest target golden_dir>/post-bridge-extraction.json`, compared with
`<candidate_dir>/post-bridge-extraction-all.json`.

Shuttle's SFC artifact
`alveo_u250_firesim_saturn_GENV256D128_shuttle_singlecore_no_nic/design/post-infer-model-ports.json`
in the archive matches the candidate's `post-infer-model-ports.json` exactly
for 51 channel connections, 51 model channel ports, seven fanout records,
one host clock, one host reset and one model transform record. Five other
reached targets have additional native SRAM model/channel records; those
model-port comparisons remain mismatches requiring separate equivalence
checks. They are not waived based on a bridge-boundary match.

The archived Rocket input FIRRTL and annotations are SHA256-identical to
`firechip.chip.FireSim.FireSimRocketConfig.sfc.fir` and `.anno.json` in the
recorded immutable `firechip.chip.FireSim.FireSimRocketConfig.sfc-golden-2026-10-01`
compiler fixture. The emitted Rocket `FireSim-generated.synthesis.xdc` also
matches nonempty lines in the immutable U250 build-tree fixture's `design/`
directory. `FireSim-generated.implementation.xdc` differs at the buffer path:
SFC uses `target/FireSim_`, while the candidate uses `target_FAMETop/FireSim`.
Clock name, divide ratio and multicycle constraints agree; this is a hierarchy
rename, not textual equality. Details are in `immutable-rocket-comparison.json`.

This is one compiled target and twelve compile gaps, not overall parity.
No manager verification or new-target metasimulation was started here.
The next small ingestion fix is accepting an absent SimpleNIC constructor
key as Scala's valid `Option.None`; NIC token-engine behavior must then be
ported. Wider/multiple TracerV, parameterized FASED geometry and partition/QSFP
semantics remain core work, with behavioral and platform/ABI validation needed.

## Optional bridge constructors, iteration 168

`BridgeAnalysis.cpp` now follows `BridgeAnnotation.toIOAnnotation`: copy the
optional serializable constructor value unchanged, and omit the field when
the source annotation has no constructor. The NIC stub's `constructorArg = None`
is valid; promotion previously rejected it because it required a dictionary.
Constructor interpretation remains the responsibility of each widget lowering.

The new `goldengate-bridge-promotion` CTest passed. It exercises missing,
dictionary and string constructor values on actual CIRCT bridge instances,
checks verified IR after instance removal, and checks the preserved data/clock
connections, endpoint targets, channel mapping and unrelated annotations.

Native replay artifacts for this compiler snapshot are under:

```
/scratch/jfx/fsim-circt/sims/firesim/sim/generated-src/xilinx_alveo_u250/xilinx_alveo_u250-firesim-FireSim-FireSimRocketConfig-BaseXilinxAlveoU250Config/iteration168-u250-target-matrix/
```

Native compiler SHA256:
`d9dacf2ff8c50db19a68e0c0f0ba8013b5ef44da34de2172ccd0c807ef19b01e`.

The exact NIC SFC golden files in the immutable matrix archive are:

```
alveo_u250_firesim_rocket_singlecore_nic/design/post-bridge-extraction.json
alveo_u250_firesim_rocket_singlecore_nic/design/post-bridge-extraction.fir
alveo_u250_firesim_rocket_singlecore_nic/design/post-wrap-top-all.json
alveo_u250_firesim_rocket_singlecore_nic/design/post-infer-model-ports.json
```

The candidate's `post-bridge-extraction-all.json` matches all nine complete
BridgeIO records and 58 channel connection records. Both sides omit the NIC
constructor key. The FIRRTL top-port comparison agrees for all nine bridge
ports, including all sixteen NIC leaves: field names, types/widths and effective
directions match after normalizing whitespace, port order and source locations.
`nic-bridge-port-comparison.json` retains the structured port contracts.

The candidate's `post-wrap-top-all.json` also matches the nine BridgeIO and
58 channel connection records, including bridge clock metadata and wrapped
targets. `nic-wrap-clock-comparison.json` retains that comparison. The model-port
boundary remains a mismatch: SFC has 58 connections, 58 model channel ports
and one transformed model; CIRCT has 68, 78 and two due to its additional SRAM
model. Eighteen fanout records, host clock and host reset agree. This requires
separate SRAM equivalence work rather than being treated as parity.

NIC replay now reaches `post-fame-cpu-stream-platform.mlir` and then fails with
`FPGA top shell: FPGATop shell would hide an input port`. Its complete stdout
and stderr are retained in the NIC replay directory. No NIC RTL or driver
support is claimed. The next small porting step is materializing SimpleNIC's
host token queues and connecting its fifteen pipe channels; the seven-token
512-bit CPU stream adapters and MMIO/driver ABI must follow. Keep the shell's
input-port check while those channels remain unbound.

The complete thirteen-target native replay finished with one compiled target,
six lowering failures and six unsupported partition profiles. All seven base
targets match their bridge/channel annotation boundaries. Shuttle also matches
the model-port boundary; the other six base targets retain SRAM-model
differences. The replay correctly exits nonzero. Its full per-target logs,
structured comparisons and actual effective profiles are in `replay/matrix.json`
and `replay/matrix.md`; no new manager gates were run.

The recorded 2026-10-01 immutable Rocket fixtures were also checked against this
snapshot. Archived pre-MIDAS FIRRTL and annotation SHA256 values still match the
immutable compiler inputs. Candidate `FireSim-generated.synthesis.xdc` agrees
with the immutable U250 design's nonempty constraint lines. Implementation XDC
agrees after the previously recorded `target/FireSim_` to
`target_FAMETop/FireSim` hierarchy rename, retaining the same clock name, divide
ratio and multicycle constraints. Exact fixture/candidate paths and results are
in `immutable-rocket-comparison.json`; this does not establish RTL equivalence.


## Iteration 169: native SimpleNIC token queues and channel gates

`addNICTokenQueues` is now part of the active native baseline compiler after
CPU stream platform assembly. A constructor-free SimpleNIC widget binds its
fifteen latency-one channels to two instantiated depth-ten FIRRTL queues.
No NIC annotation leaves the circuit unchanged. A malformed or unsupported
NIC boundary is rejected before any mutation. This is a partial NIC lowering:
seven-token CPU stream packet adapters, stream allocation, MMIO registers and
the driver ABI remain unimplemented. Compilation emits the verified
`post-fame-nic-token-queues.mlir` and annotation boundary, then reports these
missing bindings; it does not emit an incomplete FPGA design as a success.

Both queues store the 66 nonconstant packet bits (64 data, last, valid), with
asynchronous reads, synchronous writes, host-reset pointer/occupancy state,
non-power-of-two pointer wrap at nine, and flow/pipe disabled. Incoming keep
is FF. The later outgoing packet adapter must restore the constant
`data_in_ready = true` field. Target reset does not flush these queues.
All four outgoing channels participate in the token handshake, including
keep, whose data the host packet adapter discards. Each ready/valid gate
excludes only its own channel predicate. Host-to-target and target-to-host
queue progress are independent. Seven configuration inputs remain explicit;
`nic_done` exposes the combinational source for the later sampled MMIO register.

The new `goldengate-nic-token-queues` CTest passes on actual emitted operations:
12,000 randomized channel-gate cases, all fifteen isolated channel stalls,
queue-capacity stalls, independent direction progress, queue geometry and
instantiation, consumed endpoint retention, copied clock transfer, and
pre-mutation rejection of latency-two, duplicate and inconsistent clock
annotations. A regression fixture also accepts and preserves the historical
FAMETop clock identity after its physical port
has been removed by FAME lowering.

`test/Transforms/NICTokenQueuesCompare.py` compares the emitted native queue
RTL to these exact immutable SFC modules:

```
/scratch/jfx/fsim-circt/automation/chia_firesim_circt/golden/u250-sfc-20261013/alveo_u250_firesim_rocket_singlecore_nic/design/FireSim-generated.sv
Queue_17 (host-to-NIC), Queue_18 (NIC-to-host)
```

A standalone Verilator unit simulation matches every ready/valid value and
valid 66-bit payload against both SFC queues and an independent occupancy and
ordering scoreboard over 40,000 cycles: 363 full, 2,561 empty, 20,809 simultaneous
enqueue/dequeue, 353 reset, 29,610 enqueue and 28,032 dequeue cycles. Comparison
of the SFC FPGA wrapper's fifteen exclusion gates also matches the predicates
exercised by the CTest. This is unit RTL simulation, not a FireSim metasim gate.

Evidence is retained under the fresh repository output directory:

```
sims/firesim/sim/generated-src/xilinx_alveo_u250/xilinx_alveo_u250-firesim-FireSim-FireSimRocketConfig-BaseXilinxAlveoU250Config/iteration169-u250-target-matrix/
```

`nic-queues-final/comparison.json`, `sfc-gate-contracts.json`, generated native/SFC
queue RTL and complete unit build/behavior logs retain this comparison.
The next smallest porting step is the seven-token 512-bit packet adapters,
including stalled seventh-token handling and their host-reset counters, before
allocating NIC CPU streams and binding control/driver collateral.

The actual archived NIC input also reaches this boundary in `replay-final`.
All 1,792 annotation records survive queue assembly, with only the explicit
circuit and copied-port target transfer; consumed channel endpoints still
name the retained inner module. `nic-annotation-transfer.json` records the
exact comparison. Its nine BridgeIO and 58 channel connection records at
bridge extraction still match the SFC `post-bridge-extraction.json` boundary.
The later model-port boundary retains the previously recorded SRAM mismatch
(68 native channel connections versus 58 SFC); queue assembly does not claim
to resolve it. The NIC row remains a compile failure with the specific
packet-adapter/MMIO diagnostic despite this verified partial lowering.

The first replay in `replay` diagnosed an overly strict attempt to resolve
the historical `~GGCPUStreamPlatformWrapper|FAMETop>ep_3_clock` as a present
port. SFC `FAMETransform.staleTopPort` removes target Clock ports while
retaining this earlier channel clock identity. The corrected implementation
requires a common retained clock string across the fifteen channels and
preserves that identity; it uses the explicit host clock for queue state.
`replay-final` contains the corrected compiler replay, and the initial logs
remain available for that diagnosis.

The final Rocket candidate RTL is unchanged from iteration 168. The recorded
2026-10-01 immutable compiler input hashes and normalized U250 XDC constraints
still agree, including the documented implementation hierarchy rename.
`no-nic-rtl-comparison.json` and `immutable-rocket-comparison.json` record the
exact final candidate and golden paths. No manager verification gate was run.

The corrected full thirteen-target replay completed with compiler SHA256
`62bccecc3f0780ee4d5209040a2ecc24c68956a308379c1bc44a8a2c9f65f9b1`.
`replay-final/matrix.json` and `matrix.md` retain one compiled target, six
lowering failures and six unsupported partition profiles, using every
recipe's exact archived inputs and effective platform configuration. All
seven base bridge/channel boundaries match; Shuttle's model-port boundary
also matches, while the other six retain SRAM differences. The complete
replay exits nonzero. Remaining failures are multiple/non-Rocket TracerV,
FASED outstanding profiles beyond maxFlight=10, NIC packet/MMIO bindings,
and partition/QSFP semantics. Compilation and annotation matches are partial
evidence, not target behavioral or platform/ABI parity.
